 * @brief       Implements the PSA Crypto API specification.
 * @section     Configuration
 *
 * The current PSA Crypto API implementation can only be built with Kconfig.
 * The specific algorithms and implementations to be used can be configured by
 * adding an app.config file to the application or configuring them in
 * menuconfig.
 * If a driver for cryptographic hardware acceleration is available for the
 * platform, it will be used as the default backend.
