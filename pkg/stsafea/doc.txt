 *
 * # Introduction
 *
 * This package provides support for the official library for using STSAFE-A110/A100 devices.
 * 
 * # Setup
 *
 * Since the library cannot be downloaded publicly, the user has to provide it.
 * After downloading and extracting the library, copy over the sub-folder: 
 * STM32CubeExpansion_STSAFE-A_VX.X.X/Middlewares/ST/STSAFE_Axx0
 * into the RIOT package root RIOT/pkg/stsafea/
 *
 * The user must also specify if the STSAFE_A100 or STSAFE_A110 is being used by including
 * either pseudo-module e.g. `USEMODULE += STSAFE_A110`
 *
 * The connected I2C interface can be specified by defining STSAFEA_I2C_NUM. Default is 0.
 * e.g. `CFLAGS += -DSTSAFEA_I2C_NUM=2`
